    <h1>VHS Collecting is Fun!</h1>
    <h2>Not just old, dusty bricks of plastic...</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Admittedly, it was somewhat difficult trying to come up with a topic to write about on this assignment. Then it hit me: write about one of your obsessions. One of my biggest obsessions is collecting old media. CDs. LaserDiscs. Audio cassettes. Pre-recorded 8mm videotapes (yes, they exist). But the one I'm the most obsessed with is VHS.
        <br><br>
        I'm guessing this obsession comes from nostagia. As a 90s kid, I have fond memories of both renting VHS tapes at my favorite video store (while Blockbuster holds a special place in my heart, I preferred Video World) and buying tapes from various stores.
        <br><br>
        If I had to pick a favorite, it would have to be Tim Burton's <i>Batman</i> from 1989. As a lifelong Batman fan (I mean this in the most literal of sense - my mother still possesses photos of 2-year-old Joe in Batman footie pajamas), I would watch this video at least once a day. To the point where, during my childhood, I actually owned two different copies of this tape because I wore the first one out. Also, my babysitter and an aunt that I visited regularly both had copies at their house, knowing that it would be put to use upon my visit.
        <br><br>
        I could go on and on about this hobby, but instead, I'll end it here. I'm sure at some point, I'll end up writing about this subject at length, but until then...</p>

        <h2>What does a VHS tape look like?</h2>

        <p>That's right, boys and girls. Before Netflix, digital copies and DVDs, the majority of consumers watched their movies on these double-windowed blocks of plastic and film. Sure, today's media have WAY better picture quality and sound, but for a couple of decades, videocassettes delivered the joy of movies!</p>

        <h2>Why collect VHS?</h2>
        <p>There are many reasons to get into this hobby, but here's a few of the biggest pros:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's CHEAP: VHS cassettes can be bought for very little. It's not unusual to find a variety of tapes at your local thrift shop for a few dollars or less.</li>
            <li>Box art is a lost art: While Blu-rays and DVDs can have nice covers, the box art on VHS tapes (especially from the 80s) is something to admire. They just don't make 'em like they used to!</li>
            <li>Little time capsules: If you are able to procure a VCR (the device that plays videocassettes), you can see what it was like to watch movies at home 30 years ago. However, it does help if you have an old-fashioned CRT television, as flat-panel TVs do struggle to replicate the experience.</li>
            <li>It may be your only option: Although it's not as much of an issue as it was in previous decades, some movies have simply never been released on DVD or subsequent formats, especially in the horror genre. If you want to enjoy a super-obscure slasher flick, VHS might be the only way for some titles.</li>
            <li>It gets weird...in a good way: There is a ton of obscure stuff out there that, while weird and extremely dated, can be fun to experience. Instructional videos, home-recorded tapes with old TV shows or news broadcasts, and promotional tapes can be really fun and unintentionally hilarious to watch out of context. </li>
        </ul>
